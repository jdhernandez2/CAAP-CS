1) A greedy algorithm is uses optimization in an attempt to solve a problem. It solves this problem step by step so that a global solution can be accomplished. 
2) You would need to divide the total amount by a certain amount of coin in order to understand how many of that coin is necessary. By subtracting the amount that has been satisfied by the coin, you would move on to the next most appropriate coin. The goal would be to divide the total amount by the least amount of coins possible, not necessarily from largest to smallest denomination.
3) They are used to compress data or find the shortest path through the graph (https://brilliant.org/wiki/greedy-algorithm/)
